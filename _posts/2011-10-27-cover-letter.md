I sent a cover letter for a Magento position and here is the improved, cutted and blog compatible version of it:

I have been programming with PHP for 8 years and have completed many large projects. I'm currently employed as contractor in a hungarian, e-commerce driven company. The main technologies I use daily are Magento, Zend Framework and Linux. They have a good system administrator, and together with him, we solve problems. Thus because I have solid Linux sysadmin skills.

I have many contractor based roles in my past background. I was a freelancer for a very long time before, since I had an aha moment in my career. I discovered I can grow my career more effective with teams and collaboration. I'm using unit tests often, git version control system and I'm driven by agile development mindset.

After I realised the wind is too strong to fly, I decided to practice some ground handling on the bottom. Was good to kill some time and moving through my muscles in this wonderful Scottish sunshine.

Windtalker reported 28mph wind, some other paragliders appeared after lunch, the music was created by "Fele Királyság", one of the elite music bands in Hungary, you can buy their album online :)

I'm happy to introduce a new release of my Magento Quick View AJAX Extension. There was a couple of issues with it and now those has been fixed. At least, you don't need to edit any source code if you are using the default template. Just install the extension by copying it to your Magento document root folder, most cases clear the caches and enjoy!

I'm thinking about adding configurable product improvements and AJAX cart, but my time is very limited on hobby projects.

It's Open Source btw, you can grab it from here:

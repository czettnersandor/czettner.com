...please read this web page

There's an old joke among programmers about who will maintain the code when its author gets hit by a tram or a bus. More likely my paragliding canopy will collapse or I will hit by a car when I'm cycling, but it's more recognisable by the original version. This page is here so that if for some reason I'm no longer able to keep my web services running, people will know what to do.

I designate my wife as my virtual executor to organize such things. (And if you delete anything or forget to pay this server's bill, Dori, I will haunt you from the grave!)

I ask that the contents of all my hard drives be hidden in a safe, dry bit for my childs.

<h3><a title="sz치ll치s, kir치ndul치sok" href="http://turaindex.hu">turaindex.hu</a></h3>
Dori (or someone she designates) should become the new curator/webmaster. Please continue updating the site with accomodation, reply the customer enquiries, and maintain the user registered places to ensure the persistence of the content. (This means that nothing controvertial or illegal should be included. Save those for cryptome.)

<h3><a href="https://github.com/czettnersandor">Source Code</a></h3>
Copyright for my GPLed source code should revert to the Free Software Foundation. They seem to have a reasonable policy about letting people use the code.

<h3>Websites</h3>
Please keep the websites operational where possible, with content written by me kept untouched where appropriate. Appropriate pages (e.g. on sandor.czettner.hu) may contain a notice about what happened with a link to more info. The front page of sandor.czettner.hu should be redone as appropriate with a link to the old page.

<h3>Grave</h3>
I'd like to rest someplace that I liked. I'm a traditionalist, so I would prefer something christian and near my birthplace. Alternatively you can scatter me to the Norts sea, representing the rule of Nordic people.

If something does happen to me, please update the footer of this webpage with a link. Also email the relevant lists and set up an autoresponder for my email address to email people who write to me. Feel free to publish things people say about me on the site. These are probably all obvious and I'm sure you'll figure it out.

Please notify the following organisations:

<ul>
<li><span>HVIM</span></li>
<li><span>LLSC</span></li>
</ul>

Oh, and BTW, I'll miss you all.

Sandor Czettner

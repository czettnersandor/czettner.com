Last week it became official, I left behind the life Iâ€™ve known the last two and half years as a freelancer to join a new company called Ring-net.

I started working with them earlier this summer as a freelancer developing a couple of promotion websites and then later a new webshop, Kodakmedia.hu, the official hungarian wholesale site which is incomplete at this moment. The opportunity to help shape what sites will look like in the future was just too good to pass up.

I will reduce my present clientele all those that can't liquidate in time. (sorry) My VIP clients and undisclosed projects are still in business.

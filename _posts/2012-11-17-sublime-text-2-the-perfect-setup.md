I have been a long time NetBeans user and in the last year, I used Aptana as an Eclipse plugin a lot as well. I never thought these Java IDE's are fast and painless, but there was no better alternative for them.

But a couple of months ago, I found <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text</a>. And after a period of time, I found myself using it more often rather than my usual IDE. The reason is the simplicity and speed. I haven't used a stopper watch to figure out if my productivity increased, but my feeling is that has been happened so.

The basic features I fallen love with in:

<ul>
<li><span>Ctrl+P:</span> I can open files by entering the part of the filename to an amazing textbox</li>
<li><span>Ctrl+R:</span> Like my favourite IDE's class inspector, I can jump to any function in a class. Using the same text box as above</li>
<li><span>Multiple cursors</span> By using Ctrl when clicking to anywhere in the code causing cursor duplication allows me to enter the same text to multiple locations quickly</li>
<li><span>Multi selection:</span> following the same logic used for multiple cursors, with Ctrl key, I can select multiple pieces of code. How did I survive without this before?</li>
<li><span>Ctrl+G:</span> I can use it to quickly jump to a code line</li>
<li><span>Split editing</span> is a very useful feature these days with wide screen monitors</li>
</ul>

And here is my list of plugins I found useful:

<ul>
<li>PackageControl: to install/manage and update packages, the essential Sublime Text plugin</li>
<li>PhpDox: Dox Comment generator. You can automatically add the function and class documentation by pressing a shortcut. Will fix the Code Sniffer warnings as well.</li>
<li>PHP Code Sniffer: PHP Coding Standards Fixer, Linter and Mess Detector Plugin</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.emmet.io/">Emmet</a>: Official Emmet plugin (previously called Zen Coding) for Sublime Text. Can speed up html editing a lot</li>
<li>GitGutter: show an icon in the gutter area indicating whether a line has been inserted, modified or deleted since the last commit.</li>
</ul>

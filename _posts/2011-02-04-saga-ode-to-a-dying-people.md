Eyes shining bright with unspilt tears,
Thinking about all these wasted years.
Everything worth living for is gone,
Brother, i find it hard to keep fighting on.
Falling down towards the abyss,
The reaper embraces me with his kiss;
It makes me want to refuse to care,
To watch this all unfold - too much to bear.


If this is the way it ends -
If this is the way my race ends . . .
If this is the way it ends - i can't bear to witness

Disease encroaching on all i hold dear,
Somehow i gotta get my soul outta here.
Heart of agony, faint burning hope,
I'm finding it hard to try to cope . . .

Because liars own the world with conquering poise,
In a wasteland of meaningless noise;
We don't stand a chance with dormant pride,
The heroes of our race have already died . . .

If this is the way it ends - if this is the way my race ends. . .
If this is the way it ends - i can't bear to witness . . .

To imagine it has all come down to this,
Apathy and suicidal bliss . . .

It's all over except for the cryin',
With a whimper instead of the roar of a lion . . .

The greatest race to ever walk the earth,
Dying a slow death with insane mirth,
The tomb has been prepared, our race betrayed,
White man, fight the flight towards the grave . . .

If this is the way it ends - if this is the way my race ends . . .
If this is the way it ends - i can't bear to witness . . .
If this is the way it ends - if this is the way my race ends . . .
If this is the way it ends - i can't bear to witness . . .

Don't let it end this way,
Don't let it end this way,
Don't let it end this way, i can't bear to witness . . .

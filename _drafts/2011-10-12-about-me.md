I have always been interested in computers. From an early age I was playing on them, tinkering with them, programming them.

I love programming and always seem to have several side projects that I tinker with for fun and to learn new things.

I'm often researching how to improve myself, my methods, my skills.

I'm smart, recognized as such by those around me, and I get things done. If I'm not producing something I feel discontented. 

I'm opinionated, and can usually very quickly articulate the things I like and dislike about anything.

I'm a hard worker, but also a smart worker.

I love working with other smart people, and hate working on mediocre teams.

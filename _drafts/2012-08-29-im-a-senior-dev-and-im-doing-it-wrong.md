I received my new business cards just this week with the role under my name of "Senior Developer". Well, that was a surprise for me, because I didn't count myself for those smart people in enterprise environment who speaking to 300 people about the latest cutting edge software project.

I'm a MacGyver instead. But realised I'm a senior web developer now. Like far too often in the industry, I'm doing it wrong. So now it is the time for the change. Let's see where I should improve my practice:


<li><span>Mentor juniors</span> without taking time and asking the right questions. My Chinese friend in the office can learn very quickly, but He is spending half days with problems what I can solve in 10 minutes. When He asks me I just answering his questions instead of thinking about why He asked me that question. I should think more and ask questions regarding why He needed my reply.</li>
<li><span>Arguing with other</span> seniors. Completely wrong. We developers are very proud about our craftsmanship and we don't like to hear about what we are doing wrong. Even from an other developer. Somebody messing your code by avoiding the Zend Framework coding standards? Ignore it, not your business. When we introduce CI and Code Sniffing, management will blame them about those blinking warnings.</li>
<li><span>I don't write enough tests </span> as often I should. Nothing to discuss. I'm not a big fan of 100% test coverage, so I'm not testing every getter and setter methods but the 60% of my code with functional tests.</li>
<li>I often <span>care more</span> about how the code looks and using the newest technology and methodologies than about how it works for the customer (and how much will it costs).</li>

I can definitely see the above continuously while I'm working, so this post should be a todo list to be ticked out till the end of the year.

Because everybody want to be better. I want to be the best.
